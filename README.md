# Machine learning examples

For many years, I have studied Machine Learning and practiced coding. This repository has published my source codes.

## Requirement

All examples are written in Python language, so you need to setup your environments as below 

* First, install [ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

* Install TensorFlow from PyPI with the command

`pip install tensorflow`

* Install Keras from PyPI with the command

`pip install keras`

*** I used 2 library including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) for deep learning examples

* Install [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) to make my loops show a smart progress meter 

`pip install tqdm`

* Download [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (I used it to generate mpg.4) and install it. [some examples]
