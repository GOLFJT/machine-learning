# Machine learning examples

For many years, I have studied Machine Learning and practiced coding. This repository has published my source codes.

## Requirement

All examples are written in Python language, so you need to setup your environments as below 

* First, install [ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* For deep learning example, I used 2 library including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/)

You can install TensorFlow from PyPI with the command

`pip install tensorflow`

And you can also install Keras from PyPI with the command

`pip install keras`

* Install tqdm to make my loops show a smart progress meter 

`pip install tqdm`
