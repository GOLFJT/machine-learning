# Machine learning examples

For many years, I have studied Machine Learning and practiced coding. This repository has published my source codes.

## Requirement

All examples are written in Python language, so you need to setup your environments as below 

* First, install [ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

* For deep learning example, I used 2 library including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/)

Install TensorFlow from PyPI with the command

`pip install tensorflow`

Install Keras from PyPI with the command

`pip install keras`

* Install tqdm to make my loops show a smart progress meter 

`pip install tqdm`

* Download [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (tool for generating mpg.4) and install it. [Option]

## My examples (not yet)

* [Art example](Art_example)
* [Autoencoder](Autoencoder)
* [Convolutional neural network](Convolutional_neural_network)
* [Generative adversarial network](Generative_adversarial_network)
* [ImageNet example](ImageNet_example)
* [Linear and nonlinear regression](Linear_regression)
* [Logistic regression](Logistic_regression)
* [MNIST example](MNIST_example)
* [Neural network](Neural_network)

* [Principal Component Analysis](Principal_Component_Analysis)
* [Recurrent neural network](Recurrent_neural_network)
* [Text classification](Text_classification)
* [Deep Q Learning] (in progress)
