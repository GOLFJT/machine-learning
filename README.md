# Machine learning examples

For many years, I have studied machine learning and practiced coding. This repository has published my source codes

## Requirement

All examples are written in Python language, so you need to setup your environment bellow 

* First, install [ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* Then, install library for Deep learning that I use 2 library including TensorFlow and Keras 

You can install TensorFlow from PyPI with command

`pip install tensorflow`

You can also install Keras from PyPI:

`pip install keras`

## My examples (not yet) 

* [Prepare datasets](Prepare_datasets)
* [Principal Component Analysis](Principal_Component_Analysis)
* [Linear regression](Linear_regression)
* [Neural network](Neural_network)
* [Convolutional neural network](Convolutional_neural_network)
